## What is MoreNote

![MoreNote.NET Core](https://github.com/hyfree/MoreNote/workflows/MoreNote.NET%20Core/badge.svg?event=push)

Morenote is a cross-platform note hosting service built using C#, which can run on Linux and Windows platforms. Morenote is developed based on leanote, provides API performance consistent with leanote, and supports leanote's note file format to the maximum. MoreNote provides more control options and better performance and safety performanceüëè



## What we want 

Build a trustworthy open source note hosting service 

## Warning before use 

> If you plan to use MoreNotet to store your notes, please be sure to read Ôºö
> MoreNote is still under limited internal development. `MoreNote` recommends not to use or host your important notes in a production environment. It is very likely that all your notes will be lost in a crash. So, check your server, check the deployment path, and use it at your own risk. 

**feature**

* Data compatible ÔºöCompatible with Leanote notes API, you can log in directly with Leanote's desktop software or mobile software [under development] 
* Backstage management ÔºöMore powerful control panel [plan] 
* data encryptionÔºöAllow the use of encryption algorithms to protect note data [plan]
* distributed ÔºöAny client connected to MoreNote can get a complete copy based on the notes [plan]
* data backupÔºöAllows to use any data source (WebDev, FTP, OSS, etc.) to back up notes, and use any data source to restore data [plan]
* Disaster recovery ÔºöUse any complete copy or backup file to restore the note data [plan] 


## project status

The code is basically the leanote project code of fork, and the current overall project completion rate is less than 20%.

The goal of V 0.0.1 is to achieve most of the features of leanote 2.6.1. 

- Dev VersionÔºöIt is a version under development. There are many bugs and performance problems. If you don't want your software to crash at any time, please don't choose this version.
- beta VersionÔºöIIt shows that this version is stable, bugs and problems are relatively few, but the software may crash and cause problems. If you do not know software development, please do not choose this version.
- Release VersionÔºöIt shows that the program is good, and bugs and performance problems have been fixed or alleviated.
